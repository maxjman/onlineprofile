This is my first crack at a real website and I thought what better way to jumpstart my career than to show what I am capable of in web design and beyond!
                I am currently learning to code with App Academy's free program and taking the advice and mentorship from someone who has worked in the field for 20 years.
                I have been working (as an electro-mechanic) while simultaneously learning to code full-time. I always knew my current career was not going to be the one I retired with and
                now in my mid 30's, I am more motivated than ever and my focus is on switching gears to the career I wish I started before leaving high school, software development. My goal is to finish the program to
                completion and then apply my new learned skills in finding a stable job in the field. Thank you for reading my page and if you are looking for a new developer with an aptitude for
                lifelong learning and a can do attitude... Contact Me!
